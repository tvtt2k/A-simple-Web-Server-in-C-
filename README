[Webserver] - The most unoriginal name for a webserver program!

This software is just simple, a small webserver for hosting files and 
html content over HTTP. The language used is C++, and for socket networking
the Windows Socket API is used.

A few changes are going to be made in the close future:

- A "routes" function will be added (inspired by ruby on rails) so that
	the user of this program can manualy route URL's to his/her wanted
	html file. Ex: /hello/about is routed to the /about.html file.
	I've pute some though into it, and not sure how flexible i want
	this to be. If it should be able to route entire folders or just
	simple files...

- The handelig of "is this a good request?" part, and the status-codes
	that are given is a little to static and maybe not flexible enough.
	This has been worked on some, but it is stil on 200 OK / 204 NO CONTENT
	or 404 NOT FOUND...

And also, as an "way out there in the future" i would like to be able
to add support for a really simple "dynamic content" system. Say for
example that the user can write something like <% variable_name %> in
the HTML code, and get the webserver to replace that with an actuall variable.
And maybe even a SQLlite interface could be made.

Well all in all, this code is a fun project to learn about, windows network
programming, HTTP, and further down the line: SQLlite and handelig dynamic
content.
