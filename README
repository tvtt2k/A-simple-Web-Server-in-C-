Webserver - A Simple Webserver Program

This software is a small webserver designed to host files and HTML content over HTTP. It is developed in C++ and uses the Windows Socket API for socket networking.

Planned updates include the following:

A "routes" function inspired by Ruby on Rails will be added. This will allow users to manually route URLs to their desired HTML files. For example, "/hello/about" could be routed to "/about.html." Flexibility is still being considered in terms of whether it should route entire folders or just specific files.

Improvements will be made to the handling of HTTP status codes. Currently, responses are limited to 200 OK, 204 NO CONTENT, or 404 NOT FOUND. Future updates will aim to make this more dynamic and flexible.

In the long term, the addition of support for dynamic content generation is being considered. This feature would allow users to include variables in HTML (e.g., <% variable_name %>) and have the server replace them with actual values. A SQLite interface may also be integrated to support this functionality.

Overall, this project is a learning tool for Windows network programming, HTTP, and potentially SQLite and dynamic content handling in the future.
